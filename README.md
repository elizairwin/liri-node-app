# Liri-Bot

## Description: 
Liri is like the iPhone's Siri. It is a language interpreter that takes in text and returns data for the user. Here, we use the command line to ask Siri about songs and/or movies.

## Problem to Solve: 
The user needs info for songs and/or movies

## Organization: 
* Added required libraries/packages
* Defined variables to be used
* Included functions to traverse JSON
* Returned data to user with console.log
* Caught errors throughout app

## Technology Used:
* Node-Spotify-API
* OMDB API
* Axios
* JavaScipt
* Node.js

## Instructions for Use:
1. Open up command line
2. Navigate to liri-node-app
3. Type 'node liri.js' followed by one of these options:
    
    * spotify-this-song 'song name'
    * movie-this 'movie name'
    * do-what-it-says (this will pull from random.txt)
