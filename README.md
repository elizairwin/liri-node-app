## Organization: 
1. Added required libraries/packages
2. Defined variables to be used
3. Included functions to traverse JSON
4. Returned data to user with console.log
5. Caught errors throughout app

## Technology Used:
1. Node-Spotify-API
2. OMDB API
3. Axios
4. Moment
5. JavaScipt
6. Node.js

## Instructions for Use:
1. Open up command line
2. Navigate to liri-node-app
3. Type 'node liri.js' followed by one of these options:
